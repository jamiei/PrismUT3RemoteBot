# Introduction #

A Conversion Project of the [UT3 Remote Bots Project](http://www.codeplex.com/UT3Bots) originally by Andy Sterland & James Lissiak. Conversion from C# to Delphi Prism to aide the [Revenge of the Robot Rage](http://www.delphi.org/robot-rage/) project run by Jim McKeeth for the upcoming Delphi Live! conference. You will need a copy of the project template and introductory guide, translated and made available by Jim McKeeth over at the [Revenge of the Robot Rage](http://www.delphi.org/robot-rage/) before you get started.

For an introduction on how so many broken files originally ended up in the source tree see my [C# to Delphi Blog Post](http://jamiei.com/blog/2009/04/diary-of-a-c-to-delphi-prism-conversion/) for information on how we went about the intial conversion process.
